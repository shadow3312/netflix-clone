# Full stack Netflix Clone

A full stack Netflix clone backed by Python and nailed in frontend by Next.js. I wanted a full control on some critical parts for me, like the user registration and the auth flow, so I didn't want to rely on "pre-made" backends.

Deployed the backend on a private server. The live web demo is <a href="https://netflix-fullstack.vercel.app">here</a>.
